# About Me
Hi, Adi's here.  
I am interested in data analytics and wish to improve my technical skills by being active in GitHub. 
Everyday is a new day for me to learn more about Python, R, SQL, Power BI, ArcGIS and QGIS.
# Dashboards and Socio-Economics
Currently, I am learning about creating interactive dashboards from Pythoon (using Dash Plotly), Power BI, QGIS and Excel.
So, I am super keen to help any projects creating dashboards that would enable me to put my new skills into practice ;-).
In general, I am interested to collaborate in data analayst or research projects in Economics, 
especially in studying the impact of natural disasters -including Covid-19 pandemic, blockchain for index-based insurance, 
and using night time lights to analyse socio-economic dynamics as well as building the apps for those research findings.
