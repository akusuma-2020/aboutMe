# About Me
Hi, Adi's here.  
I'm interested in data analytics and wish to improve my technical skills by being active in GitHub. 
Everyday is a new day for me to learn more about Python, R, SQL, Power BI, ArcGIS and QGIS.

# 
I'm currently learning to create interactive dashboards using Python (Dash Plotly), Power BI, QGIS, and Excel. 
I'm also interested in exploring open-source CGE (Computational General Equilibrium) models in Python for policy analysis. 

I'm excited to apply these skills to collaborative economic analyses or research projects.

My specific interests include studying the impact of natural disasters, including exploring blockchain for index-based insurance, and utilising nighttime lights for analyzing socio-economic dynamics.
